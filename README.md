## Abstract
Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) can affect personal, social, academic, and job-related skills, and communication is one key area that often suffers. 

**Social MatchUP** is a cooperative game designed to support children with Neurodevelopmental Disorders (NDDs) by improving their communication and cooperation skills. The main challenge in previous versions of the game was ensuring that players remained engaged while overcoming communication difficulties. While earlier iterations successfully introduced Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) to create an immersive and interactive experience, some users still struggled with progressing through tasks independently. Additionally, maintaining focus throughout the game posed a challenge, especially for children with attention-related difficulties. 

The latest version of Social MatchUP introduces a significant enhancement: the integration of a **Large Language Model** (LLM) embodied as a virtual assistant named **Buddy**. Buddy is a visual robot that provides real-time assistance, offering game instructions and guidance when a player is stuck. By responding dynamically to player needs, Buddy ensures that children can navigate challenges without frustration, allowing them to continue engaging with the game. The assistant also plays a crucial role in helping users maintain focus, providing encouragement and interactive prompts tailored to their in-game behavior. To further enhance the user experience, visual hints have been incorporated into the gameplay, making interactions more intuitive and reducing cognitive load for the players.

## The game
The core of the approach involves a cooperative sorting mini-game that require players to communicate to complete tasks, effectively promoting verbal production and social engagement. The sorting game requires players to sort a set of balloons. To win the game the objects’ order must be the same for both the players.
Balloons have different colors so that the users can differentiate them. 

To ensure communication between the users, each player cannot see the complete game view of the other, but rather only if a position is occupied or not. To complete the activity, players need to describe each balloon and choose together the position it will occupy. 

Unlike traditional interventions, which can be stressful or ineffective in capturing sustained attention, Social MatchUP integrates game mechanics that naturally encourage conversation and cooperation.
