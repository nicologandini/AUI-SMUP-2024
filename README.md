# Social Match UP XR
Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) can affect personal, social, academic, and job-related skills, and communication is one key area that often suffers. To tackle this challenge, this work focuses on using cutting-edge technology to make a difference. The project centers around designing a Cross Reality (XR) game named Social Matchup (SMUP-XR), which adapts and enhances an existing cooperative VR and AR game to boost communication and teamwork skills for individuals with NDDs. This document details the creative journey, from design choices and technological methods to the testing process, demonstrating how SMUP-XR can positively impact social skills development and make interactions more engaging for those affected by NDDs.

The latest version of SMUP introduces a significant enhancement: the integration of a Large Language Model (LLM) embodied as a virtual assistant named Buddy. Buddy is a visual robot that provides real-time assistance, offering game instructions and guidance when a player is stuck
